# Lawyer Appointment Management System

## Project Overview

Lawyer Appointment Management System is designed to help people in Bangladesh easily connect with qualified lawyers. It acts as a central system that keeps everything well-organized for both clients and lawyers. The platform helps users find legal support based on specific needs—such as family matters, property disputes, or business issues. 

It stores key information about clients and lawyers, ensures appointments are scheduled properly, and keeps records of all legal cases and payments. To ensure trust and safety, the system verifies important contact details like email addresses and phone numbers. After a meeting or case, clients can leave feedback about their experience. This helps others find reliable legal support based on honest reviews. 

In short, this platform simplifies the process of getting legal help by keeping all information secure, organized, and easy to access—for both clients and lawyers.
